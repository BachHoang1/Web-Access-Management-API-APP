# WEB Manamgent API APP
To start up project locally you need to run mongodb and have nodejs installed.
Install MongoDB with the link: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
Install nodejs with https://nodejs.dev/
You then start the mongo server with 'mongo' in the command line
in the directory it was installed (most likely going to be in C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin as it is the default folder).
Then you can run the program in the terminal with 'npm install' and then to start the server with 'npm start'
Or cd into the project directory and run the command 'npm install' then use 'npm start' or 'node server.js'.
It will be listening on port 3000 on local server.
Then go to a browser and use http://localhost:3000/
